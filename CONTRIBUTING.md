## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to help create a welcoming and respectful community.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Install [Go 1.24+](https://golang.org/dl/).
3. Run `go mod tidy` to install dependencies.
4. Run `make build` or use your preferred method to build the CLI/client.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lakekeeper/go-lakekeeper/issues).
- Include a clear title and description.
- Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

### Suggesting Features

- Open an issue
- Provide context and possible use cases.

### Submitting Changes

- Fork the repo and create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
- Make your changes
- Format your code: `make fmt`
- Run tests: `make test`
- Commit and push your branch
- Open a pull request and follow the PR template

## Coding Guidelines

- Use `gofmt`, `golangci-lint`, and `go vet` before submitting.
- Keep your changes focused: small, atomic PRs are easier to review.
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines.

## Regenerating the API client

The Management API client (`pkg/apis/management/v1/`) is generated from
the upstream OpenAPI spec — **do not hand-edit any file in that
directory.** The full regeneration workflow, including the OpenAPI
preprocessor and the generated/manual file boundary, is documented in
[docs/GENERATION.md](docs/GENERATION.md). The short version:

```sh
make generate
```

## Testing

Run all tests before opening a PR:

```sh
# Unit tests
make test

# Integration tests
make test-integration
```

If adding a feature or fixing a bug, include relevant unit and/or integration tests.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all CI checks pass (unit tests, linters, etc.)
2. Make sure your branch is up to date with `main`
3. Link related issues in the PR description
4. A maintainer will review your PR and may request changes
5. Once approved, your PR will be merged into `main`

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).
